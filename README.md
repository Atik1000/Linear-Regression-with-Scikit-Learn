I will only post the iPython notebooks and they will be posted as I finish them myself. This helps me to keep a track of my studies
and also refer to it on the fly while I am at work. Reference:

# what is machine -learning-mean
As a human wha we will do something understand --


1)Collect Data
2)Understanding data and make mathematical formulas
3)predict future

so if we will train a machine then it will work as a human that is called machine -learning.
