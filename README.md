# Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Bootcamp

I will only post the iPython notebooks and they will be posted as I finish them myself. This helps me to keep a track of my studies
and also refer to it on the fly while I am at work. Reference:

# what is machine -learning-mean
As a human wha we will do something understand --

1)Collect Data
2)Understanding data and make mathematical formulas
3)predict future

so if we will train a machine then it will work as a human that is called machine -learning.

#Types of Machine-learning
there are 3 types of Machine-learning methods----

#supervised machine learning:

            <p>One practical example of supervised learning problems is predicting house prices. How is this achieved? First, we need data about the houses: square footage, number of rooms, features, whether a house has a garden or not, and so on. We then need to know the prices of these houses, i.e. the corresponding labels.</p>

    <h2><b> Unsupervised machine learning: :</b></h2>
    <p>Unsupervised Learning areas of application include market basket analysis, semantic clustering, recommender systems, etc. The most commonly used Supervised Learning algorithms are decision tree, logistic regression, linear regression, support vector machine</p>

                <h2><b> Reinforcement machine learning:</b></h2>
                <p> Some of the autonomous driving tasks where reinforcement learning could be applied include trajectory optimization, motion planning, dynamic pathing, controller optimization, and scenario-based learning policies for highways. For example, parking can be achieved by learning automatic parking policies</p>
